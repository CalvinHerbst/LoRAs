## Overview

HerbstPhoto_v4_Flux2 is a LoRA model that introduces authentic analog film characteristics to Flux 2 Dev outputs. Trained exclusively on analog photography I own the rights to—no scraped data, no unlicensed material.

**What it does:**
- Filmic softness and natural grain behavior across exposure levels
- Emulsion bloom & halation
- Optical artifacts: lens flares, light leaks, chromatic aberration, barrel distortion
- Aggressive low-latitude contrast: clipped highlights, crushed shadows

The result: images that feel shot, not generated.

## Usage

### Trigger Word
```
HerbstPhoto
```
Include this in your prompt.

### LoRA Strength
| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `0.4 - 0.75` | Balanced aesthetic, good prompt adherence |
| `0.73` | **Sweet spot** |
| `0.8 - 1.0` | Max texture/degradation, reduced prompt adherence |

### Resolution
- Recommended: `2048x1152` (16:9) or `2488x2048`
- Works well up to 2K at various aspect ratios

### Samplers & Schedulers

Tested extensively. These combinations work best:

```python
# Recommended combinations (sampler + scheduler)
SAMPLER_CONFIGS = [
    ("dpmpp_2s_a", "sgm_uniform"),    # Top pick
    ("er_sde", "ddim_uniform"),
    ("dpmpp_sde", "simple"),
    ("dpmpp_3m_sde_gpu", "simple"),
    ("ipndm", "simple"),
    ("dpmpp_sde", "ddim_uni"),
]
```

### Prompting Tips

Flux 2's `mistral_3_small_fp8` text encoder handles long, complex prompts—but this LoRA produces dramatic effects with simple, natural language. You don't need style, texture, or lighting tokens.

```python
# Simple prompt example
prompt = "HerbstPhoto, portrait of a woman in golden hour light"

# Also works, but not required
prompt = "HerbstPhoto, portrait of a woman, warm afternoon light, shallow depth of field"
```

## Ethical Training

This model is trained **exclusively** on photographs I created and own. 

I believe we can take control of AI's potential by training on our own material—and that we can build accessible tools that empower individuals, not just corporations.
